					There is this perception that agriculture has not achieved its aim in
					Africa. For us, we know that to build a transformative business,
					sustainability and empowerment are critical. We believe that our
					growth should be synchronous to that of our community. This is why we
					have built an agribusiness that employs our women and youth, that
					employs forward thinking and capacity building and that embraces the
					beauty of the soil and of agriculture.

				<h3 className="mission__headline">How are we moving?</h3>
				<p className="mission__content">
					We pride ourselves in quality and a strong ethical culture. Our labor
					comprises 75% women from our locality and youth, we train and equip
					them to work for us and for themselves. We have a clear focus of where
					we are going as a business and this can only be done ethically and
					sustainably. That there, is our mantra.
